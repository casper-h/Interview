# Interview Preparation
* How many iterations have your resume gone through? If it's < 3, don't apply to any companies until that statement is true.
* Create a range of companies that you'd want to work at
  * Extend this list to include companies that you'd be okay to work at.
  * Are you willing to relocate? Add more.
* Research about different companies, understand their culture, and most importantly, what they do!
* Reach out to recruiters, it might be rought at first, but getting a job is difficult.
  * Maybe even consider reaching out to managers, sometimes they post about hiring as well!
