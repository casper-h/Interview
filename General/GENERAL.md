# Key Ideas

* Repeating the questions out loud, understand what the question is asking
* Ask questions to clear up the question
    * What are the given assumptions?
    * Are there any special requirements?
    * Contraints?
* Practice speaking and presenting your thought process
* Work out the examples
    * The most optimal solution may not always be clear, start simple with Bruteforce
    * Check for edge cases, any exceptions
    * Implement any known algorithm that can help the problem (be sure to vocalize the reasonings)
* What if the solution has bugs?
    * Divide and Conquer
        * Start small, trace back and isolate each component
* Understand time/space complexity ([for the lazy](https://www.bigocheatsheet.com/))
