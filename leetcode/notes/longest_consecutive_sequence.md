- Constraints:
    - Time Complexity: `O(n)`
- Initial attempt solved the problem with using Heap, however:
    - `heapify` is `O(n)`
    - `heappop` is `O(logn)`
- The overall complexity using a Heap becomes `O(nlogn)`, which is worst than the constraint of `O(n)` time
- The idea is pretty much the same, we still are interested in tracking a local maximum against a global maximum
    - What if we don't need to actually sort the underlying list?
