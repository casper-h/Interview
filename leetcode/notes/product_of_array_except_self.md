- Constraints:
    - Time Complexity: `O(n)`
    - Space Complexity: `O(1)` (output array excluded)
- Straight forward solution is to create arrays that calculate the prefix and suffix sum (not space optimized)
    - Imagine: `[3, 3, 2, 5]`
    - `pre = [1, 3, 9, 18]`
    - `suff = [30, 10, 5, 1]`
- What if we only need to count at each point the prefix and suffix, directly using the output array?
    - Instead of constructing the array, what if we keep track of the prefix and suffix as we traverse?
